## Introduction

Modern AI systems often face two big challenges:  
1. How to give accurate answers grounded in real data.  
2. How to safely interact with external tools and APIs.  

Two concepts are at the center of these solutions: **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.  
They are related but solve different problems. Understanding their roles helps clarify how today’s AI agents are built.

## What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that improves an AI’s answers by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base, such as documents, databases, or APIs, before generating a response.  

This allows the AI to move beyond the static training data it was built on, reducing hallucinations and providing up-to-date, context-rich answers.

### Why RAG Matters

LLMs are powerful, but they can only respond based on what they were trained on. With RAG, you can connect them to your own data sources: company policies, research papers, or customer documentation. This makes them more useful in real-world scenarios.

## What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a **standardized communication protocol** that defines how AI applications (clients) can interact with external services (servers).  

It is not a model or a technique, but a set of rules. MCP uses JSON-RPC (2.0) for handling requests and responses, which means every interaction between an LLM (client) and an MCP server follows a structured JSON format for making remote procedure calls.

**Example JSON-RPC 2.0 request and response:**
```json
// Request: Claude (MCP client) asking GitHub MCP server to create a pull request
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "create_pull_request",
  "params": {
    "repo": "fwwz/awesome-app",
    "branch": "feature-x",
    "title": "Add new feature"
  }
}

// Response: GitHub MCP server returns the result
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "url": "https://github.com/fwwz/awesome-app/pull/42",
    "status": "success"
  }
}
```

In other words:  
- **RAG is about context**: fetching relevant knowledge.  
- **MCP is about connectivity**: providing a safe, standardized way to access external resources.

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Feature | RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) | MCP (Model Context Protocol) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Concept** | A **technique** to ground LLM responses in external data. | A **protocol** for connecting LLMs to external tools, APIs, or data sources. |
| **Primary Goal** | Improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations. | Provide a **safe, extensible, standardized** bridge between LLMs and external systems. |
| **How It Works** | 1. Retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base. <br /> 2. Add them to the model’s context. <br /> 3. Generate a grounded response. | 1. LLM (client) sends a JSON-RPC request. <br /> 2. MCP server calls the underlying service or API. <br /> 3. Server returns result to the client. |
| **Analogy** | A student writing a report: go to the library, read references, then write. | A universal power adapter: safely connect to any outlet (tool or API). |
| **Relationship** | RAG is a **pattern** that may use MCP as its foundation. | MCP is a **framework** that can enable RAG and many other applications. |

## How They Work Together: Example

Imagine an AI assistant that answers questions about your company’s documentation.

**Without MCP**  
You would write custom code connecting the AI directly to a vector database. This is brittle, hard to maintain, and poses security risks.

**With MCP**  
```txt
User: "What is our vacation policy?"

Claude (MCP client):
  → sends request { "action": "search_docs", "params": {"query": "vacation policy"} }

MCP Documentation Server:
  → queries internal knowledge base
  → returns relevant HR policy document

Claude:
  → uses returned context to generate a grounded answer
````

This is a RAG system built on top of MCP.

## Real Example: GitHub and Claude

MCP is not limited to RAG. For example, if you want Claude to open a pull request on GitHub:

```txt
Claude (MCP client):
  → sends request { "action": "create_pull_request", "params": {
      "repo": "fwwz/awesome-app",
      "branch": "feature-x",
      "title": "Add new feature"
    }}

MCP GitHub Server:
  → translates request into GitHub REST API call
  → authenticates securely
  → creates pull request
  → returns PR link

Claude:
  → responds with "I have opened a pull request: <link>"
```

Instead of coding custom integrations for each LLM, MCP provides a standardized interface that any compatible model can use. For example, once you have a GitHub MCP server, Claude, GPT-4, or any other MCP-enabled LLM can interact with GitHub through the same endpoint.

A practical demonstration of this can be found in this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ixuiih/showed_off_claude_37_sonnet_in_a_vibe_sesh_to_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), where Claude seamlessly interacts with GitHub's API through MCP. 

This standardization showcases two key benefits of MCP:
1. **Interoperability**: Write once, use with any compatible LLM
2. **Security**: All API interactions are handled by the MCP server, not directly by the LLM

## Practical Use Cases of MCP

MCP servers can expose many different tools:

* **Flight Booking Tool**: interact with multiple airline APIs through one interface
* **Calculator Tool**: ensure math is executed correctly
* **Weather Tool**: fetch live weather updates securely
* **Calendar Tool**: read and update schedules
* **Filesystem Tool**: safely browse and edit files in a sandbox

By abstracting away API differences, MCP allows AI agents to operate more like advanced automation scripts that can think.

## Key Takeaways

* **RAG** is a technique for grounding LLM responses with external data.
* **MCP** is a protocol that standardizes how LLMs connect to tools and data.
* Together, they enable AI agents that are accurate, extensible, and safe.
* While REST APIs already exist, MCP introduces a consistent structure that LLMs can natively understand.

## Conclusion

RAG and MCP are not competing ideas, they complement each other.

* RAG focuses on *what* the model does: improve answers with the right context.
* MCP focuses on *how* the model connects: safely and in a standardized way.

As AI agents evolve, expect MCP to play a growing role in connecting LLMs to the real world, with RAG as one of its most important applications.
