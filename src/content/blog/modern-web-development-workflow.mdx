# Building a Modern Web Development Workflow

In 2025, web development has evolved significantly. Let's explore the essential tools and practices that make up a modern development workflow.

## The Foundation: TypeScript and Modern JavaScript

TypeScript has become the de facto standard for large-scale web applications. Here's a practical example of how we can leverage TypeScript's type system:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  preferences: {
    theme: 'light' | 'dark';
    notifications: boolean;
  };
}

const updateUserPreferences = async (
  userId: string, 
  preferences: Partial<User['preferences']>
): Promise<User> => {
  // Implementation
};
```

## Modern Build Tools: The Vite Advantage

Vite has revolutionized how we build web applications. Here's why it's superior:

1. **Lightning-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)**
2. **Optimized Build Performance**
3. **Native ESM Support**

## Component Architecture

Modern React applications benefit from a well-structured component hierarchy. Let's look at a practical example:

```tsx
type ButtonVariant = 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'ghost';

interface ButtonProps {
  variant?: ButtonVariant;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: () => void;
}

const Button = ({ variant = 'primary', children, onClick }: ButtonProps) => {
  return (
    <button 
      className={`btn btn-${variant}`}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

## State Management in 2025

While Redux dominated the past, today's applications often use simpler solutions:

- Zustand for global state
- React Query for server state
- Context API for theme/auth states

## Performance Optimization

Modern web apps need to be fast. Here are some key techniques:

1. **Code Splitting**
```tsx
const MyComponent = lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));
```

2. **Image Optimization**
```tsx
<img 
  src="hero.jpg"
  loading="lazy"
  srcSet="hero-400.jpg 400w, hero-800.jpg 800w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 400px, 800px"
  alt="Hero image"
/>
```

3. **Web Vitals Monitoring**

## Deployment and CI/CD

Modern workflows typically include:

- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Vercel/Netlify for hosting
- Automated testing and linting

## Conclusion

The web development landscape continues to evolve, but focusing on these fundamentals will help you build better applications in 2025 and beyond.
